# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Java and Python. It serves as a practice collection for common coding problems and algorithmic challenges.

## Algorithms Implemented

- **Binary Search**: Searches for a target value in a sorted array (LeetCode 704).
- **Closest to Zero**: Finds the number closest to zero in an array, preferring positive if both exist (LeetCode 2239).
- **Merge Alternately**: Merges two strings alternately (LeetCode 1768).
- **Roman to Integer**: Converts Roman numerals to integers (LeetCode 13).
- **Is Subsequence**: Checks if one string is a subsequence of another (LeetCode 392).
- **Max Profit**: Calculates the maximum profit from stock prices (LeetCode 121).
- **Longest Common Prefix**: Finds the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings (LeetCode 14).
- **Summary Ranges**: Summarizes the ranges of consecutive numbers in an array (LeetCode 228).
- **Product Except Self**: Computes the product of all elements except the current one (LeetCode 238).


## How to Run

### Java
Compile and run the Java file:
```bash
javac dsa.java
java dsa
```

### Python
Run the Python file:
```bash
python dsa.py
```

## Usage
Uncomment the desired function calls in the main method (Java) or at the bottom of the file (Python) to test different algorithms.
